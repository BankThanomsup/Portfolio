    "This is a program I developed based on my personal needs. The objective is that when we exercise, knowing our BMI and BMR allows us to understand how much we should eat each day and whether our body condition is within a healthy range, whether we are overweight or underweight. This makes it easier to design workout plans. Therefore, I developed this program to meet these objectives.",
